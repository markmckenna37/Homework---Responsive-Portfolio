# Homework---Responsive-Portfolio


For this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a functional portfolio page with 3 different tabs. Functionality of the page included nav bars that link between the 3 pages, and using bootstrap to add responsiveness to the html elements, such as sizing images and containers to different sized screens and view ports.
Other specific tasks included using bootstrap to create different sized containers, rows, and columns, using semantic tags, links to social media pages, having a contact info form, and a sticky nav bar and footer.
Different pages required different column settings. but using the sizes xs, sm, md, and lg in the bootstrap class "col-''-6" I adjusted the elements to fit certain sizes. For small devices, columns were typically 12 units wide, while larger screens were closer to 6-8.
